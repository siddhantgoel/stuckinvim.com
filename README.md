## About

StackOverflow recently released a [blog post] according to which, there are about
80 people per hour that need help getting out of Vim.

[stuckinvim.com] is a small interactive tutorial that asks you a bunch of
questions, and tells you what you should do to exit Vim. The website is
completely static and the application logic is written in [VueJS].

## FAQ

### Why did you write this?
Because as we speak, there are people out there stuck in vim, not knowing how to
exit.

### Your tutorial does not cover the case when the user is doing X.
Maybe. Even though I use Vim daily, there are still some functions I'm not aware
of. Please either [create an issue] or [open a pull request]. ðŸ™‚

### The site design is ugly.
Please either [create an issue] or [open a pull request]. ðŸ™‚
